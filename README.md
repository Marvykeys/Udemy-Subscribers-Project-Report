 ## Scope:page_with_curl:
 This report is focused on studying the preferences of subscribers, their subscription trends and other useful insights using the provided data on courses from different topics.
 ## Data Design:bar_chart:
 The raw data provided was downloaded in CSV file format which came with some of its contents being incorrect and improperly formatted hence, a proper data cleaning had to be done by removing duplicates, renaming cells, creating filters and also deleting empty rows.
 ## Import and Transform Data :scroll:
 After downloading the data which contained four different CSV files, I imported the data into Microsoft Excel being the tool I’ll be using for analysis. Then I clicked on these in order. (Data > Get Data > From File > From Folder)

Next, I selected the folder in which the file was saved, then I selected the four CSVs. 
A description box popped up with details of the four CSVs and multiple options to click on. I clicked on “Transform Data” because I want to combine all four CSVs into one spreadsheet.

Next, the Microsoft power query editor appears and then I clicked on the two downward arrows on the content column to merge the CSVs.

The “Combine Files” box pops up, I was satisfied with the settings so I clicked OK.

Now, you see below, all four CSVs are joined and the number of rows is now 3,681 rows loaded.                                                                     ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/130637591/232913848-073975b3-aad0-4bd3-86be-e05cdc9692b5.png)
